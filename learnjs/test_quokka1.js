// There are three ways to declare a variable in javascript

var myname = 'Yune';// var is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program

let your_name = 'Dude';// let will only be used within the scope of where you declare them

const pi = 3.14;// const should be a variable that never change, if you try to change it you gonna get an error

// In java script we better end all lines with a semicolon ;
var a;
var b = 2;
a = 7;
b = a;
console.log(a)
console.log(b)
